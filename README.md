# PITSTOP

Code Institute - User-Centric Frontend Development - Milestone Project

PITSTOP is a website inpired by the city i live in Amsterdam.
I created this concept of bicycle repair shop start-Up website. Many of the concetps of services offered were created by me,
it doesn't exist yet in Amsterdam but i believe in the future it will.

The store offers services like 24/7 repairs and pick up and drop services, and bicycle maintanance services. Dutch people
really love their bicycles and maintanance and having a good mean of transport is crusual to dutch society functionality, 
especially the city of Amsterdam.

 
# UX
 
This website is for anyone who lives in Amsterdam that has bicycle.
This applies to students, young professionals, the elderly, families and for those whom lives are extremely busy.

Every young professional and people who are just busy all day long this concept is a perfect product for them.
For example: 
* The 24/7 service would be great for students. 
* The maintanance reminder would be great for families who carry children on their bicycles which it can be 
dangerous to have a faulty bike and you can be putting your kids in danger.
* Pick up and drop service is great for those who don't have time to spare or those who simply don't want 
or have time to take their bicycleto our shop, we can come to you.



# Strategy 

My goal was to make sure the website was as user-friendly as possible clean and straight forward.
I wanted to make sure people could understand what the business offers so that it could best help 
Amsterdamers with their needs when it comes the bicycles they dearly love and have being imprinted into their
way of life sense they were 3 years old.


## Technologies Used

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap (4.4.1)


## Testing next

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
